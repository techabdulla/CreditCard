# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By employing logistic regression, the goal is to develop a reliable model that minimizes false positives and negatives, ensuring real-time fraud detection and protection for financial institutions and customers.

## Objective

To design a system that reliably detects fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression. The model aims to:
- Provide real-time fraud detection.
- Avoid false positives and negatives.
- Enhance protection for financial institutions and customers.

---

## Motivation

Credit card fraud, while infrequent, poses a significant risk to both customers and companies due to financial and reputational losses. Given the challenge of imbalanced datasets (legitimate transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones), this project aims to develop an effective detection system that identifies fraud without overwhelming users with false alerts.

## Modules

### Module 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

**Input**: 
- Credit card transaction data, including features such as transaction amount and time.

**Functionality**:
- Load and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, remove duplicates).
- Implement feature selection and engineering (e.g., time intervals between transactions).
- Use Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.

**Output**:
- A clean, preprocessed dataset ready for model training.

---

### Module 2: Model Training

**Input**:
- Preprocessed dataset.

**Functionality**:
- Perform binary classification using logistic regression.
- Apply L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Train the model with cross-validation for optimal hyperparameters.

**Output**:
- A trained logistic regression model.

---

### Module 3: Model Evaluation

**Input**:
- Test dataset.

**Functionality**:
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC.
- Use confusion matrices to assess true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**Output**:
- Performance results and a detailed analysis of the modelâ€™s metrics.

---

### Module 4: Real-Time Processing and Future Enhancements

**Input**:
- Real-time credit card transaction data.

**Functionality**:
- Implement real-time fraud detection in financial applications.
- Notify administrators and customers of potential fraudulent activities.

**Output**:
- A system capable of real-time fraud detection with adaptive retraining for evolving fraud patterns.
